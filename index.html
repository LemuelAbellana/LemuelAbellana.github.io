        <h3>Favorite Food</h3>
        <p>There are so many food that I Love. But Lechon, is my favorite among all of them.
          Eating Lechon allows me to have the sense of happiness since we can only eat that food
          when there is a celebration. On the other hand, I love eating anytype of Chicken dishes
          in which I prioritize the breast part of the chicken since I can gain large amount of
          protein in that part.

        <h3>Favorite Game</h3>
        <p>My Favorite Game is Valorant. Ever since Valorant was released, I was able to play that game to
          spend my free time. In addition, that is the first game I've played ever since we've got a WiFi at
          home during the pandemic. Playing Valorant makes me realize that I am able to compete. In addition,
          I can spend time with my friends as well.

        <h3>Favorite Sport</h3>
        <p>Playing basketball has always been a part of my life. Ever since I was a child, I was really inclined
          in any type of sports. However, Basketball is my favorite sport since I was inspired by the late legend
          Kobe Bryant due to his work-ethic and great approach in life. "Is Job Finished?" is one of his saying
          that constantly boosts my work-ethic to finish my tasks.
