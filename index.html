   About Me: 
   <br>
        <br>

        Hi! I am Lemuel G. Abellana, born on February 1, 2004 in Davao City, Philippines.
        I am a Second Year Student under the program of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of the Immaculate Conception. 
        I am a person who is trying to find my purpose and passion in life. I am finding ways to always improve and leverage myself for me, my family, and to my girlfriend.
        I am trying my best to learn and become one of the great programmers or data scientist since I find those things satisfying and helpful in all aspects when it comes to business.
        With these, I am a student who seek learning in all sorts of subjects in this program.

    Favorites:  
    <br>
        <br>
        The word Favorites is very broad in which I will be focusing on food, hobbies, and moments. 
        When it comes to food, I really love eating Fish Fillet, Chicken Fillet, Fries, and Pork.
        When it comes to hobbies, I love reading books and playing online games.
        When it comes to moments, my favorite moment is when my girlfriend gave me a YES.

        School Projects
        <br>
        <br>
        We have conducted our first final project in Computer Programming 2 on our First Year here at the University of the Immaculate Conception.
        The Project is known as "BOOK-IT-NOW" which is an ICTDU Booking System that allows the users to book a specific meeting room known as ICTDU.

        Talents
        <br>
        <br>
        I think I have a talent in programming. Although I am a newbie, I am willing to improve this talent so it will turn into skills.
