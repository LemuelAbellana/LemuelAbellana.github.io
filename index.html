    Hi! I am Lemuel G. Abellana, born on February 1, 2004 in Davao City, Philippines.
    I am a Second Year Student under the program of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of
    the Immaculate Conception.
    I am a person who is trying to find my purpose and passion in life. I am finding ways to always improve and leverage
    myself for me, my family, and for my girlfriend.
    I am trying my best to learn and become one of the great programmers or data scientist since I find those things
    satisfying and helpful in all aspects when it comes to business.
    With these, I am a student who seek learning in all sorts of subjects in this program.

        <h2>Favorites:</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">

    The word Favorites is very broad in which I will be focusing on food, hobbies, and moments.
    When it comes to food, I really love eating Fish Fillet, Chicken Fillet, Fries, and Pork.
    When it comes to hobbies, I love reading books and playing online games.
    When it comes to moments, my favorite moment is when my girlfriend gave me a YES.

    We have conducted our first final project in Computer Programming 2 on our First Year here at the University of the
    Immaculate Conception.
    The Project is known as "BOOK-IT-NOW" which is an ICTDU Booking System that allows the users to book a specific
    meeting room known as ICTDU.

        <h2>Talents</h2>
    </div>
  
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">

    I think I have a talent in programming. Although I am a newbie, I am willing to improve this talent so it will turn
    into skills.
